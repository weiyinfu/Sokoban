# Sokoban-Solver-AI

My code for a Sokoban Solver AI that is able to solve 23 of the 40 extra sokoban maps provided (test_script_alternate.py). The heuristic for tree search involves deadlock finding and simple estimates of movement contriction within the map. [Sokoban game](https://www.sokobanonline.com/)
